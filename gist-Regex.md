# Regex Tutorial
Regex, or regular expression, is a method for matching data patterns such as emails or phone numbers. It involves searching for specific patterns within the text.


## Summary
Today, I'd like to delve into the world of regular expressions used for validating email addresses. Email addresses are incredibly common, and understanding how to work with them using regular expressions can be quite valuable. One such regular expression for validating email addresses is as follows.
^(([^<>()[]\.,;:\s@"]+(.[^<>()[]\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|.(".+"))@(([[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}])|(([a-zA-Z-0-9]+.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$
